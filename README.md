# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv8 model for car image segmentation. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The YOLOv8 model used here is pre-trained on a large dataset, enabling it to effectively detect and segment cars in various images.

# Features
1.Real-time car detection and segmentation
2.High accuracy and efficiency
3.Easy to use and integrate into other projects
4.Provides bounding boxes and segmentation masks for cars
# Dataset
The model used in this project is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which includes a wide variety of objects, including cars. For this specific project, the focus is on segmenting car images.

# Model
The project uses the YOLOv8-seg.pt pre-trained model, which is specifically designed for segmentation tasks. This model is part of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models known for their speed and accuracy in object detection and segmentation.

# Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

# Clone the Repository:
1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/car_segmentation_using_yolov8n-seg.git
2. cd car-image-segmentation-yolov8

# Create a Virtual Environment:
1. python -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
# Usage
To use the car segmentation model, follow these steps:

1.Download the YOLOv8 Model:
2. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8-seg.pt model and place it in the project directory.

# Results
The YOLOv8 model provides accurate and efficient car segmentation. Below are some example results:

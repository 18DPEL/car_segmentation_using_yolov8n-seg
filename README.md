# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv8 model for car image segmentation. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The YOLOv8 model used here is pre-trained on a large dataset, enabling it to effectively detect and segment cars in various images.

# Features
Real-time car detection and segmentation
High accuracy and efficiency
Easy to use and integrate into other projects
Provides bounding boxes and segmentation masks for cars
